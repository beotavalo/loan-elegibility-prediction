# Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project is part of the [MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) offered by Data Talks Club cohort 2024.
## Introduction
In today's competitive financial landscape, efficient loan approval processes are crucial. This project aims to develop and deploy a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict loan eligibility. By leveraging MLOps practices, we will build a robust and automated system for loan assessment. This will enable faster loan decisions, improve customer experience, and optimize risk management for the financial institution.

## Problem Statement: Loan Eligibility Through Traditional vs. Machine Learning Approach

**Traditional Loan Approval Process:**

Currently, loan eligibility decisions are primarily made through human underwriters who assess various borrower data points like income, credit score, employment history, debt-to-income ratio, and collateral. This manual process can be time-consuming, prone to bias, and lack consistency, leading to potential delays and dissatisfied customers. Additionally, it can be challenging to accurately assess the creditworthiness of non-traditional borrowers who may lack extensive credit history.

**Machine Learning Approach:**

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project proposes a Machine Learning (ML) model to automate and enhance the loan eligibility prediction process. The model will learn from historical loan data, identifying patterns that differentiate between approved and rejected loan applications. This data-driven approach can lead to:

-   **Faster Approvals:** Automated predictions can significantly reduce processing time, allowing for quicker loan decisions.

-   **Reduced Bias:** ML models are objective and unbiased, mitigating the risk of human judgment influencing loan decisions.
-   **Improved Efficiency:** Streamlined loan assessment frees up underwriters' time for more complex cases.
-   **Enhanced Risk Management:** The model can identify risk factors and predict potential defaults, allowing lenders to make informed decisions.

**Complete ML Project Process:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
    -   Historical loan application data will be collected, including borrower information, loan details, and approval status.

    -   Data cleaning procedures will ensure data quality and address missing values or inconsistencies.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Data visualizations will be used to understand the distribution of loan features, identify potential correlations, and uncover any hidden patterns.
    -   Feature importance analysis will assess the influence of each factor on loan eligibility.
3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    -   New features will be created based on existing data to improve model performance.
    -   Data scaling may be applied to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
4.  **Model Training and Selection:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
    -   Various ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting will be trained and evaluated on a portion of the data.
    -   Model selection will be based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.  **Model Tracking and Version Control:**
    -   The chosen model will be versioned and tracked using MLOps tools to monitor performance changes over time.
    -   This allows for easy rollbacks to previous versions if performance degrades.
6.  **Model Testing:**
    -   The final model will be rigorously tested on a separate hold-out set to assess its generalizability and ensure it performs well on unseen data.
    -   Explainability techniques like SHAP values will be used to understand how the model arrives at its predictions.
7.  **Model Deployment:**
    -   The production-ready model will be integrated into the loan application system.
    -   Real-time predictions can then be generated for new loan applications.
8.  **Monitoring and Continuous Improvement:**
    -   The deployed model's performance will be continuously monitored through key metrics.
    -   Periodic retraining with new data will be conducted to ensure the model stays accurate and adapts to changing market conditions.
